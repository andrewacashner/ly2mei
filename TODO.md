- (DONE) deal section headings
- (DONE) deal with barlines
- (DONE) deal with ties
    - (DONE) Verovio gives warning message about ties: need to make separate tie element
- (DONE) deal with lines:  slurs, lines (coloration) 
    - (DONE) Avoid creating duplicates
    - (DONE) Need to encode lines in the measure of their startID note
- (DONE) deal with multiple articulations on one note
- (DONE) deal with Lyrics
    - NB we are ignoring markup or other \commands within lyrics

- deal with FiguredBass
    - (DONE) add basic classes, MEI output
    - add constructors to parse input and create those classes
        - need to store staff number enclosing the figured bass
        - need to calculate time stamp from durations
        - need to parse ly text commands

- figured bass looks like this, within `<measure>`:

````
<harm staff="5" place="below" tstamp="1">
  <fb>
    <f>6</f>
    <f>â™¯</f>
  </fb>
</harm>
````


- deal with differing numbers of measures in diff. voices
- support \IncipitStaff and \InstrumentName in \score

# Optimize, refactor

(DONE for current code 5/3)

- Consistency with private variables vs. public getters/setters (properties?)
- Consistency with class functions vs independent
- Consistency with constructors vs other functions that create items
    - especially class methods of one class that create another class
    - (TRIED, GAVE UP) change from Class.ToMEI to MeiNode.Create(Class)
        - current system works and is consistent
        - using constructors does not work when the function needs to be able
          to return nil (e.g., List.ToMEI => nil when List.Count = 0)
- try/finally more?
- Remove unused code

- Improve basic parsing functions (e.g., TLyObject\.Create) to reduce number
  of states, conditions, loops; too confusing at present
